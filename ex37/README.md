Exercise 37 goes through the Key words in python... this
is a good one to learn what the different ones do. 

Here is the list from the exercise: 

    * and      - boolean AND
    * del      - removes vars/obj elements
                 see: del.py
    * from     - imports a module from a package
    * not      - boolean NOT operator
    * while    - loop keyword
    * as       - gives a module a different alias
                 see: as.py
    * elif     - means "else if"
    * global   - declares a variable is bound to global scope
    * or       - boolean OR
    * with     - executes code a new controlled context
                 see: with.py
    * assert   - create inline test, throws `AssertionError` if fails
                 see: assert.py
    * else     - branching, a catch all
    * if       - logic branch
    * pass     - do nothing, useful for empty functions/blocks
                 see: del.py
    * yield    - like `return`, but returns an generator
                 see: yield.py
    * break    - jumps out of a loop
    * except   - catches an exception in a `try/except/finally` block
    * import   - imports the symbols from a package
    * print    - outputs text to STDOUT
    * class    - declares a Class
    * exec     - takes code as string, runs it. `eval` is similar but returns a value
    * in       - test collection membership
                 see: in.py
    * raise    - triggers a new exception
                 see: raise.py
    * continue - jumps to the top of the loop
    * finally  - tear town step/block of a try/except/finally block
    * is       - tests "identity" not "equality"
                 see: is.py
    * return   - exits a function w/ a value
    * def      - defines a new function
    * for      - loop
    * lambda   - creates a new inline function
    * try      - creates a block that catches exceptions
